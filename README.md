### Exploitation-of-Content-Management-System-Vulnerabilities-to-Launch-Large-Scale-Cyber-Attacks

`This was the my final year project, that I have done in CERT-In(Indian Computer Emergency Response Team), New Delhi.`

### Overview:

Content management systems (CMS) provide a customizable multi-user environment with a default set of functions that are needed to create, organize and maintain web content. One of the main features of CMSs is the modularity which allows users to add various functions that are appropriate for their needs. First CMSs appeared in late 1990s, but they have become popular in middle 2000s. There are over 200 CMSs developed in various programming languages such as PHP, Java, Perl, .NET and others, divided in open-source and proprietary CMSs, each one with its own supported databases (eg. MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, PostgreSQL).
The Content Management System is a Web-Based application that provides capabilities for multiple users with different permission levels to manage content, data or information of a website.


### Abstract:

Content Management Systems are mostly used for website development. Websites are the main targets of various malicious attackers, and therefore it is necessary to be knowledge about the security level of websites. This will describe some features of the well-known open source Content Management System platforms: Drupal, WordPress and Joomla.
The security of such web applications depends as much on vulnerabilities found in plugins as it does in vulnerabilities in the application core. One of the biggest problems facing the IT security industry is the use of vulnerabilities in legitimate software to launch malware attacks. Malicious programs can use these vulnerabilities to infect a Content of Websites without attracting the attention of the user and in some cases, without triggering an alert from security software. The cyber-attacks, or more specifically denial of service attacks, were launched by the Cyber fighters of Izz Ad-Din Al Qassam also known as Qassam Cyber Fighters. Operation Ababil was one of a series of cyber-attacks starting in 2012, targeting various American financial institutions and carried out by a group of Izz Ad-Din Al Qassam.


### Problem Statement:

Most used CMS in world today are WordPress, Joomla and Drupal which are all open source software built on PHP with MySQL database support primarily. WordPress alone is used by more than 23.3% of the top 10 million websites as of January 2017 with around 60% of CMS market share and more than 60 million websites altogether. Joomla and Drupal together take around 10% of CMS market share. We’ll analyse main causes of security problems in CMS in general and compare their security with enterprise CMS solutions. Since CMS security dominantly depends on security of underlying systems (server, database server and web server) we will briefly cover the comparison between three most used CMS (Linux Figure 1. Vulnerabilities by Type 4 server, MySQL or Maria DB as database servers and Apache as web servers) with underlying Microsoft technology for running CMS (Windows Server, MS SQL as database server and .NET based CMS running on IIS as web server). We’ll give analysis of most abused and most severe cases of vulnerabilities and try to identify most common ways in which they are being exploited. Analyses importance of community in preventing widespread abuse of newly discovered vulnerabilities. Analyses effectiveness of CDN 2 and their ability to eliminate standard threats. Final goal of this project is to securing open source CMS.
